# @imikailoby/lastfm-ts

TypeScript-based client for the [Last.fm API](https://www.last.fm/api), designed to streamline access to its methods and JSON responses.

> [!NOTE]
> This package is currently under development in my spare time. All available API methods will be added shortly. Please note that this is a work in progress, and as such, the functionality and features are subject to change.

## Installation

```zsh
  # via yarn
  yarn add @imikailoby/lastfm-ts

  # via npm
  npm install @imikailoby/lastfm-ts
```

## Usage

1. Obtain the **Last.fm API Key** ([Read more](https://www.last.fm/api#getting-started)).
2. Initialize the `LastFm` class with the obtained API key.

Example:

```ts
import { LastFm } from '@imikailoby/lastfm-tsâ€™;

const lastFm = new LastFm('api_key'); // Insert your API key

lastFm.user.getInfo({ user: 'imikailoby' }).then((response) => {
    const { user } = response;
    // Do something with user data
});
```

This client accommodates varying response structures from different API methods by utilizing generic types.

For example, the response of [user.getPersonalTags](https://www.last.fm/api/show/user.getPersonalTags) varies based on the `taggingtype` parameter. Specify the `taggingtype` as a generic type when calling the function to ensure TypeScript accurately reflects the response structure.

```ts
import { LastFm } from '@imikailoby/lastfm-ts';

const lastFm = new LastFm('api_key'); // Insert your API key

// Use generic type 'artist' for specific response structure
lastFm.user.getPersonalTags<'artist'>({ user: 'imikailoby', taggingtype: 'artist', tag: 'rock' }).then((response) => {
    // Attempting to access 'albums' will result in a TypeScript error
    // Error: Property 'albums' does not exist on type 'UserGetPersonalTagsArtistsResponse'
    const errorExample = response.taggings.albums;

    // Accessing 'artists' is valid for 'artist' tagging type
    const validExample = response.taggings.artists;
});
```

## TODO

-   [ ] `auth` methods
-   [ ] `chart` methods

## Notes

Some insights into specific feature implementations, highlighting discrepancies between the Last.fm API's documented and actual behaviors as of the dates mentioned.

-   **24.12.2023** | `user.getFriends()` does not have the `recenttracks` param despite it being present in the documentation. [Reason why](https://support.last.fm/t/friends-recent-listening-is-not-returned-with-user-getfriends-method/5825).

-   **24.12.2023** | The API returns the `streamable` attribute for some objects, but their interfaces do not have this attribute. [Reason why](https://support.last.fm/t/is-the-streamable-attribute-broken-it-always-returns-0/39723/1).

-   **24.12.2023** | `user` does not have the `getWeeklyChartList()` method despite it being present in the documentation. Looks like the method is dead. [More info](https://support.last.fm/t/user-getweeklychartlist-doesnt-return-the-latest-charts/7333/2).

-   **26.12.2023** | `geo.getTopTracks()` does not have the `location` param despite it being present in the documentation. [Reason why](https://support.last.fm/t/geo-gettoptracks-list-for-an-optional-location-metro/7446).
